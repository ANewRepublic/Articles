# The Articles

Welcome to the governing articles of a mythical nation called "A New Republic".

In this new republic, the people govern directly or via delegates at their discretion.

Laws are authoritatively tracked via git.
All proposed changes to law are guaranteed a review period by the people and their delegates.
See [policy discussions](articles/policy_discussion.md) for how people can participate in debates and discussions around proposed or enacted law.
The changes become law when the review period has passed and a sufficient number of votes are FOR the change, as described by law.

The Articles are national-level laws.

Sub-jurisdictions apply additional laws.

## Areas for expansion

- Review "scope" in the Articles
- Indecent exposure
- Encourage productive, responsible members of society.
- Deal with homelessness.
- Legislative
  - What can we do to encourage stale laws to be removed? (expiration dates for all laws? community PRs?)
  - Congressional budget office equivalent?
  - The budget must be balanced at all times.
  - Capital expenses will be paid up front -- not with bonds for future generations to pay. Debt is bondage.

  - One page bills that focus on just one issue.
- Judicial
- Executive
  - can they pick and choose which laws to enforce?

- Laws must be forward-facing, cannot discriminate by geography, political leanings, race, sex, creed,
- Pursuit of wealth will not be criminalized or penalized.
