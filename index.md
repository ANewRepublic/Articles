# The Articles

Welcome to the governing articles of a mythical nation called "A New Republic".

In this new republic, the people govern directly or via delegates at their discretion.

Laws are authoritatively tracked via git.
All proposed changes to law are guaranteed a review period by the people and their delegates.
The changes become law when the review period has passed and a sufficient number of votes are FOR the change, as described by law.
