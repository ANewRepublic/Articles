# Articles of A New Republic

This repo contains an evolving draft of governmental policy ideas that in my pipe dream would be adopted by a new nation.

## Caveats

- The Articles have language that may contain TODOs or half-baked ideas.
- The Articles speak of enforcements, policies, or workflows that are not actually implemented.

## Discussions

- I welcome policy discussions or other ideas for taking this forward in the Discussions tab.
