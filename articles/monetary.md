# Monetary policy

The government does not print money nor dictate the form money should take.

Government payments (e.g. taxes, public services, etc.) are made via cryptocurrency payments on some blockchain that conforms to [privacy](privacy.md) policy.

See [taxation](taxation.md) and [privacy](privacy.md).

## Encourage privacy



## Redistribution of wealth and care for the needy

## Public education

Tax funds will never be spent on public education, whether higher or lower education.

Education is a general good and should be encouraged, but should not be provided at the federal level.

If libraries and schools are provided at lower levels of government, no policy shall be enacted at any level of government that treats them with any form of preference over privately funded alternatives.
