# Introduction

These articles are the laws of the land.

## Limited government

The laws at the national level are very limited in scope.

The scope includes:

- Protection of domestic life and physical property within the national borders from hazards foreign and domestic.
- Treaties with other nations scoped only to peace, trade, and alleyship.

The scope excludes everything not expressly included above.
Implicitly excluded scope cannot be exhaustively enumerated.
Enumerating a subset might be misleadingly reassuring to allow scope creep if something is not on that list.
That is not intended in the following *excluded* scope, but we list an exclusion list anyway to call out areas where other governments have encroached that we explicitly call out as forbidden:

- Education
- Providing goods (care of the poor is left to the people)

Changes to the scope requires a super-majority of votes.

## Periodic application of changes to law

All changes to law are enacted on a regular interval on the 15th of every month.

### Technical Mechanics

Changes to law are merged into a staging branch which is automatically merged into the enforced branch on the designated day.
