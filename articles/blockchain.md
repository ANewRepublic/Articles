# Governance blockchain

Certain governance operations are recorded on the governance blockchain.
These include:

1. Citizenship awards, revocations, and renewals.
1. Delegation of voting powers.
1. Votes
1. Pushes to the authoritative branch of the legislative git repo.
   As git itself is something of a blockchain, only the commit ID need be pushed to the blockchain rather than the git database itself.

## Privacy

The blockchain is publicly available and audited.
It leverages cryptography and zero-knowledge as needed to abide by [privacy laws](privacy.md).
