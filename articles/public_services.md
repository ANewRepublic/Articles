# Public services

## Resources

Resources are consumable public goods and services.

Resources should be paid for by those who consume them.
Pricing may change according to supply and demand to distribute according to need.

Life preserving natural resources (e.g. water) may have consumption limits in order to ensure life preserving amounts for everyone are available.

### Expected fallouts

- Toll roads
- Shifting costs to those who use the roads rather than spreading them around.
- Incentivize reduction of use of roads.

How will public services be funded? (e.g. taxation, pay for use, etc.)
