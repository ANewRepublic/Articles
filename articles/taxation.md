# Taxation

## Allowed taxation

### Real estate tax

* WHEREAS the government's *chief* job is to protect life and property.
* WHEREAS the costs of this are proportional to the size of the real estate under protection and the value thereof.
* THEREFORE real estate may be taxed, based on its size and perceived value.

Real estate ownership is recorded on the [blockchain](blockchain.md) and associated with citizenship or an alternate legally registered entity such as a business.

Failure to pay real estate taxes eventually results in sale at auction of the real estate to a citizen or other legal entity.
The starting bid is the amount in back taxes.

## Forbidden taxation

* Trade. This includes but is not limited to retail purchases, bartering, gambling, or human labor and services.
* Property, meaning personal property such as items you can carry or otherwise move around.
* Net worth
* Capital gains

## Non-normative discussion

Having taxes exclusively or primarily derived from real-estate size and value may be perceived at being unreasonable penalizing to businesses or livelihoods that rely on a high amounts or values of real estate.

Rather than considering this to be a penalty, we think of this as being a necessary directional flow of money toward these businesses.
For example a farmer that has a very high real estate tax bill will necessarily pass this cost on in the price of food.

This will drive the real costs of all goods into their marketplace prices.
This will incentivize innovation to reduce these costs rather than spread them around via unrelated taxation that would remove such incentives and leave inefficiencies.
