# Policy discussions

Policy discussions can of course happen everywhere.

To help focus meaningful, thought-out discussions a forum is hosted with a "pay to say" system.
Sharing ideas or commenting on the ideas of others requires a micropayment to be made.

Non-binding votes to promote ideas may be made by citizens.
Such votes also carry a cost to ensure they are thoughtfully cast.
Such votes are verified to be cast by citizens via a zero-knowledge cryptographic proof,
and each citizen can only vote once on a particular comment.
