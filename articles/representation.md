# Representation

Every adult [citizen](citizenship.md) has 1 vote.

This vote applies to their local jurisdiction and every enclosing larger jurisdiction up to the national level.

An adult may delegate their vote to a representative of their choosing for a given jurisdiction.
They may revoke or change this delegation at any time.

Delegation is not required.
A citizen may retain their voting power to directly influence any law.

## Technical implementation

Each citizen is in possession of a cryptographic certificate.
This certificate is used to vote or can delegate their voting power to a representative.

Voting and delegation is recorded on the governance blockchain.
