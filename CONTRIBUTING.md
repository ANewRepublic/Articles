# Contributing to the Articles

Contributing to the articles will eventually be a democratic process, where every change of law is enacted by pull request.
Changes will be cryptographically signed and pull requests will only merge when approved by a particular % of the governed as specified by the Articles.

## Technical aspects

Refer to [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for how to write markdown files.

Add images to the *images* folder if the file is referencing an image.
